First of all, make sure to source your workspace. To launch the simulation with Gazebo, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 sim.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


To launch the simulation with Coppelia, please run\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{roslaunch rt2\_assignment1 coppelia.launch}
\end{DoxyCode}


This version won\textquotesingle{}t open Gazebo simulator. Thus, open Coppeliasim.\+sh in another shell and load the rt2\+\_\+scene.\+ttt present in the main brach.
